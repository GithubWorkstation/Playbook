1. Immediate Isolation

Isolate affected systems to prevent the spread of malware. Disconnect from the internet and other networks but avoid shutting down systems as it might trigger additional malware functionalities.
2. Classification and Analysis

Submit the malware samples to multiple antivirus vendors to classify the type and family of the malware [1]. Determine the scope of the attack and the data affected.
3. Implement Containment Strategies

Prioritize containment to prevent further encryption or data loss, especially for ransomware attacks. Ensure backups are not connected to the network and are free of malware [4].
4. Eradication and Recovery

Remove the malware from all systems after identifying all affected assets. Use updated antivirus software and tools recommended by cybersecurity professionals.
5. Notify Relevant Stakeholders

Inform all affected parties, including customers, vendors, and regulatory bodies, about the breach. Provide them with details about what data was compromised and the steps you are taking to address the situation.
6. Review and Update Security Measures

Post-incident, review and strengthen security protocols. Implement stricter access controls, update software, and increase cybersecurity training for employees [6].
7. Documentation and Legal Compliance

Document the incident response process for future reference and legal compliance. Review the incident's cause and revise your incident response plan accordingly.
